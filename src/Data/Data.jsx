    title:"Lower your sucrose (sugar) intake",
    content:`
    <p>
    Several studies have suggested an association between sucrose, or table sugar, and an increased risk of Crohn’s disease2,12. Too much sugar also increases your risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and more13. In a typical American diet, sugar primarily comes from sugar-containing beverages (like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Dr. Pepper, punch, and sugar-sweetened iced tea) and desserts and pastries (like cakes, cookies, pies, donuts, muffins, and ice cream). Most guidelines recommend limiting your sugar intake to less than 10% of your total calories—that’s about 45 grams per day of sugar for women and 55 grams per day of sugar for men4. However, some guidelines, like the American Heart Association, recommend even less—no more than 25 grams per day for women and no more than 36 grams per day for men14.
    </p>
  
    <p>
    Try cutting down on your sugar intake. Here are some tips:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pay attention to nutrition labels and ingredients. Choose foods that have the lowest amount of “added sugars” or foods that have no added sugars.</li>
        <li>Many beverages are loaded with added sugars. Use these recipes to replace sugary drinks with fruit-infused water  for a boost of flavor, or try seltzer or sparkling water instead.</li>
        <li>For dessert, choose fruit salad instead of sugary desserts.</li>
        
        <li>When baking cookies or cakes, try cutting the sugar in half—you often won’t notice the difference.</li>
    </ul>
